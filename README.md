In this project we are implementing the feedback system using Na√Øve Bayes theorem,using the principle of predicting the
output given the test cases given in the Data Set.We either predict whether the feedback is good or bad. 

The training set is limited but the accuracy of the algorithm is pretty efficient with just so many tuples.
Then the input to the machine is the feedback forms which has 4 attributes i.e. 4 questions and each can take 3 values.

Then we classify the input into a good feedback or bad feedback by calculating the conditional probabilities.
